# Programming-Things-Assignment-1
The first assignment for the Programming "Things" module in my final year.

This involves us programming a small Zumo robot with an arduino board, ultrasonic sensor and xBee communications board to navigate a maze of corridors and rooms, as if it was a search and rescue robot.
